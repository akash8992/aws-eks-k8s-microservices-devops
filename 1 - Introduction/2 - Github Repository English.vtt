00:00.000 --> 00:00.840
-: Welcome back.

00:00.840 --> 00:03.840
In this lecture, we are going to look into three

00:03.840 --> 00:07.800
GitHub repositories available for this masterclass course.

00:07.800 --> 00:11.010
So we'll have AWS EKS Kubernetes Masterclass

00:11.010 --> 00:14.460
under StackSimplify, and also two more repositories.

00:14.460 --> 00:17.010
You can see it here under the course modules,

00:17.010 --> 00:20.370
for Docker Fundamentals, one repository,

00:20.370 --> 00:24.210
and Kubernetes Fundamentals, one more repository.

00:24.210 --> 00:27.090
So, in detail, you'll have everywhere, wherever you go,

00:27.090 --> 00:29.310
you'll have a step-by-step documentation

00:29.310 --> 00:31.500
available for all the things.

00:31.500 --> 00:32.970
So everywhere you'll find

00:32.970 --> 00:35.310
a detailed step-by-step instructions

00:35.310 --> 00:38.100
including the kubectl commands you need to deploy

00:38.100 --> 00:41.730
and the Docker images you need to execute and everything.

00:41.730 --> 00:44.550
So all these three repositories,

00:44.550 --> 00:48.360
you can either fork it and then log into your GitHub repo,

00:48.360 --> 00:51.510
and then fork it so that you have everything at your place

00:51.510 --> 00:52.920
means like at your GitHub repo,

00:52.920 --> 00:56.370
or you can download them as a zip and then unzip

00:56.370 --> 00:59.400
and then use it from your local desktop.

00:59.400 --> 01:01.470
So anything is fine.

01:01.470 --> 01:05.160
So now, if you see here, so all these things, right?

01:05.160 --> 01:07.080
So one more thing you need to understand here

01:07.080 --> 01:11.100
is in every of the sections, in any of these sections,

01:11.100 --> 01:14.430
you'll find something called kube manifests folder.

01:14.430 --> 01:16.020
So inside that only you'll find

01:16.020 --> 01:18.300
all your Kubernetes manifests

01:18.300 --> 01:20.550
for whatever the use case you are implementing

01:20.550 --> 01:22.500
everything will be found there.

01:22.500 --> 01:24.330
So when you're progressing through the course

01:24.330 --> 01:26.220
you are going to understand in detail

01:26.220 --> 01:28.350
but I am just trying to explain you

01:28.350 --> 01:31.710
that the kube manifest folder is for mainly holding

01:31.710 --> 01:35.847
the Kubernetes manifest in entire course.

01:35.847 --> 01:38.100
This completes the introductory part

01:38.100 --> 01:41.430
of Kubernetes Masterclass in AWS.

01:41.430 --> 01:43.770
So we'll start with the hands-on exercises

01:43.770 --> 01:45.000
from our next lecture.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.330
Primarily we'll start with the creating a EKS cluster

01:48.330 --> 01:51.240
using EKS CTL in our next lecture.

01:51.240 --> 01:53.130
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

01:53.130 --> 01:54.270
Until then, bye bye.

01:54.270 --> 01:55.103
Thank you.
